## About

Owning a big server? Can't use many public plugins just because you worry that they can harm your network? Want to monitor and/or restrict Internet activity, file access and other stuff for certain plugins? **That's all exactly what Keiko comes for.**

### [â†’ Keiko on SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/keiko-server-security-and-plugins-inspections.66278/)


**Keiko is capable of:**

* inspecting bytecode of plugins at startup and check them for potentially unsafe operations or malware, including "Force-OP";

* monitoring and restricting nearly every single action plugins do, including network connectivity, file access, natives linkage, and more, with an easy to use and understand rules syntax;

* checking the integrity of installed plugins, ensuring they are not artificially modified or infected;

* ***[planned]*** detecting suspicious behavior of plugins at runtime.


## Installation

Go to **[releases page](https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/keiko-plugin-inspector/releases)** and download the latest Keiko release JAR, then put it in your server's `plugins/` folder and restart.

> **IMPORTANT:** if you're runnning a BungeeCord network, make sure to install Keiko **both** on the Bungee itself and on **all** its 'child' (Bukkit) servers. This will let Keiko protect not only all your endpoints, but also your Bungee (proxy)!
